# Helmet_Detection_Yolov8m
This repository contains the implementation of a Helmet Detection System using the YOLOv8m (You Only Look Once - version 8 medium) object detection model. The goal of this project is to automatically detect and classify whether a person is wearing a helmet in an image or video feed or real-time webcam.
